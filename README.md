# calendarproject_github
I made this program for the Athletic Director and the coaches at my school. It creates Google Calendar events for games from a Google Sheets schedule. 
I made it specifically to work with the scheduling format the Athletic Director at my school uses, but with some tweaking, this could be applied to many other services as well.
This is my first useful python project, so any feedback would be appreciated. 
I'm hoping to add a feature that will check for any updates in the Google Sheets, and won't create duplicate features for events that haven't changed.
